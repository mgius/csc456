This is the template I passed out in the lab (well, slightly 
modified).  It works reasonably well to have each step of the
lab be a {\textbackslash section} and each component below it
a {\textbackslash subsection}.  For the ``problem set'' labs
an {\tt enumerate} environment is probably more appropriate.


\setcounter{section}{1} % make the first section, section 2(see below)
\section{Logging in}

This example is actually the second step in this lab so I had
to change the section number to match.  If you want to
set section numbers, you can do so with 
\verb+\setcounter{section}{+$n${\tt \}}.  Set $n$ to be one less
than you want it to be.


\subsection{Approach}
  The login procedure is to enter the username at the ``{\tt login:}''
prompt followed by the password at the ``{\tt password:}'' prompt.
The username for the user account I created is ``{\tt pnico}''.  The
password is not recorded here for obvious reasons.

\subsection{Problems Encountered}

  I was distracted and hit too many returns to wake up the terminal, 
ended up entering the login name at the password prompt, and typing
my password at the following login prompt:

{\tt\begin{tabbing}
login:\\
password: pnico\\
\\
login: $<${\it password withheld}$>$\\
password:
\end{tabbing}}

\subsection{Solutions}

  The solution was to re-enter my login name and password at the
  appropriate prompts.  I also checked to see if the bad login
  had been logged to {\tt /usr/adm/log}, because that would have
  been a security risk.  On this system bad logins are not logged,
  so there was no breach.

\subsection{Lessons Learned}

  In this section I learned to pay attention while logging in to
the machine.  I also learned how hard it is to come up with bogus
problems having to do with logging in.  (Forgetting that {\sc Unix} is
case sensitive is more likely.  Still more likely is ``none'' for
this particular task.)
