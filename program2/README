Program 2

No Special instructions

I spologize for the awful conventions around output in kasiski.  I haven't
done stream IO in C since 101, and when I tried to make it work, it spit on me
so I went back to write(2).  

I wasn't able to crack my hard after an hour of putzing around.  Somebody 
mentioned that their hard one was "easy," so I cracked his and made the
assumption that my text was from the same source.  Lo and behold, there's a 
9 in my input, and there's only one 9 in the source.  Done and Done.

Comparing my "assume everything is an e" result to the actual key, I only
matched 3 of the 5, so it was pretty much noise is far as I could tell.
