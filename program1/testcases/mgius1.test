The following message will be vignere encoded using a fairly long key.  The problem with this of course is that I, as a human, cannot properly create random data.  I don't particularly care about this point.  the other problem with this message is that it contains an awful lot of punctuation.  Punctuation is a very bad thing, at least for our enciphering method, which just ignores punctuation.  If we wanted to be a little sneakier our program would strip out punctuation, leaving it to the person on the other end to add them back in.  This would leave some ambiguously worded messages rather unclear.  I mean 'your mother, that cow, and her shark' is totally different from 'your mother that cow and her shark.'
