\section{System Description}

The system is a low-powered Atom PC, small form factor 
(it is less than 12" on each side, and about 3" tall), 
with a 320GB hard drive and 2GB of ram.  
The system is located in my bedroom in a house in San Luis Obispo, 
on top of another computer.  It is plugged into a surge protector, 
but not a UPS.  The surge protector is shared with several other computers.
The system has no input devices plugged into it 
(keyboard, mouse, webcam, etc).

The system is connected to the internet via a switch in my bedroom 
that is shared with several other desktops. The bedroom switch connects 
to a shared house switch via a cable that runs along the floor of 
the hallway leading to my bedroom.  The shared workgroup switch 
has connects to a Linksys router running DD-WRT (linux), connected to 
a DSL modem (local ATT affiliate ISP).

\section{"Conclusions"}

Overall, I would rate the risk level of this system as ``low''.  Almost all 
of the threats evaluated are known, and are mitigated in some fashion.  The 
only publically accessible route into the system is an OpenSSH service. 
OpenSSH has a long (long) history of being coded by paranoid security fanatics.
In addition, OpenSSH is listening on a non-standard port, which mitigates
the effects of automated bots. In addition, the machine only really provides 
one important function, that of a source code repository for myself. Because
I recently switched from subversion to git, 
I now have several such repositories that I sync to.

The data on the system consists primarily of these repositories of 
programs and a collection of MP3s.  These MP3s are backed up to other locations
periodically.
