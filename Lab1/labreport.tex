\section{System Description}

The system is a low-powered Atom PC, small form factor 
(it is less than 12" on each side, and about 3" tall), 
with a 320GB hard drive and 2GB of ram.  
The system is located in my bedroom in a house in San Luis Obispo, 
on top of another computer.  It is plugged into a surge protector, 
but not a UPS.  The surge protector is shared with several other computers.
The system has no input devices plugged into it 
(keyboard, mouse, webcam, etc).

The system is connected to the internet via a switch in my bedroom 
that is shared with several other desktops. The bedroom switch connects 
to a shared house switch via a cable that runs along the floor of 
the hallway leading to my bedroom.  The shared workgroup switch 
has connects to a Linksys router running DD-WRT (linux), connected to 
a DSL modem (local ATT affiliate ISP).
