The ``X'' in ``BEEN'' is a padded character to force the message to be an 
even number of characters

\item % Problem 2: # of keys
I am assuming that the term ``Classical Cryptosystem'' refers to a system where
the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

Assuming that each person wants to communicate securely with everybody else,
and each person is willing to send a separately encrypted message if a message
needs to be sent to more than one person, then there will need to be one key
for each unique pairing.  This works out to 
\[\frac{(m-1) m}{2}\]
which also happens to be the number of edges in a fully connected graph 
with $m$ nodes.

If sending multiple copies of a message is disallowed, this increases the
number of keys required.  For every possible group of persons greater than 2,
a key is required.  Looking up the equation for $m$ choose $k$ gives me

\[\frac{m!}{k!(m-k)!}\]

So now I'll just sum all of the possible groupings for a group of size m

\[
\sum_{k=2}^{m} \frac{m!}{k!(m-k)!}
\]

Running the numbers for a group of size 4, I get $6 + 4 + 1 = 11$ keys to 
allow every combination of persons to securely communicate amongst each other.

\item % what if #2 was PKI

If the group of people in problem 2 were allowed to use a public key 
cryptosystem, the number of keys required would be $m * 2$. Each person would
need their own Public key and their own Private key.
